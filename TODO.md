# Task: Add Percentage Display to Parcel Status Cards in Dashboard (Corporate Futuristic Style)

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Update TODO.md with the new task steps
- [x] Edit components/dashboard-view.tsx to pass total parcels as prop to each StatusCard
- [x] Edit components/status-card.tsx: Add total prop to interface, calculate percentage (count / total * 100, formatted to 1 decimal + '%'), and render it on the right side of the header in a corporate futuristic style (e.g., small rounded badge with glassmorphism, subtle gradient background matching colorClass, clean sans-serif font, white text with slight glow/shadow for futuristic effect)
- [x] Verify the edits for syntax and logic (e.g., percentage calculation handles total=0, styling aligns without overlap)
- [ ] Test application: Run `pnpm dev`, upload data, navigate to dashboard, confirm percentages display correctly on right of each card, update with filters/regions, check responsive layout
- [ ] Create feature branch (e.g., blackboxai/status-card-percentages), commit changes with message "Add percentage display to status cards in futuristic style", push, and open PR to main
