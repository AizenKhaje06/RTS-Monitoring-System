# Analytical Report Dashboard Update

## Current Status
- âœ… Analyzed existing analytical-report.tsx component
- âœ… Identified current visualizations: regional parcel counts, top provinces, top shippers, RTS destinations

## Planned Changes
- ðŸ”„ Replace current visualizations with new priority visualizations:
  - Predictive Risk Dashboard - Return probability heatmap
  - Customer Intelligence Matrix - RFM segmentation chart
  - Geospatial Optimization Map - Delivery efficiency layers
  - Portfolio Performance Grid - ABC analysis visualization

## Implementation Steps
1. Update analytical-report.tsx to include new visualization sections
2. Implement return probability heatmap logic
3. Add RFM segmentation chart component
4. Create geospatial optimization map with delivery efficiency layers
5. Build portfolio performance grid with ABC analysis
6. Update data processing logic to support new visualizations
7. Test all new visualizations with sample data

## Dependencies
- May need additional chart libraries for heatmaps and advanced visualizations
- Ensure data structure supports new analytical requirements
