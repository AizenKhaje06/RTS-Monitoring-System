# RTS Monitoring System Code Review and Dashboard Verification

## Completed Tasks

### Code Accuracy Check
- [x] Reviewed main app structure (app/page.tsx)
- [x] Checked dashboard layout and navigation (components/dashboard-layout.tsx)
- [x] Verified dashboard content and view components (components/dashboard-content.tsx, dashboard-view.tsx)
- [x] Examined report components:
  - [x] Analytical Report (components/analytical-report.tsx)
  - [x] Performance Report (components/performance-report.tsx)
  - [x] Financial Report (components/financial-report.tsx)
- [x] Reviewed data processing (lib/excel-processor.ts)
- [x] Checked upload functionality (components/upload-modal.tsx, file-upload.tsx)
- [x] Fixed linting errors:
  - [x] Added missing ParcelData import in analytical-report.tsx
  - [x] Replaced 'any' type with proper ParcelData type
  - [x] Added missing dependency in useMemo hook
- [x] Verified TypeScript types (lib/types.ts)
- [x] Ran ESLint - no errors remaining
- [x] Built project successfully
- [x] Started development server (running on http://localhost:3001)

### Dashboard Functionality Verification
- [x] Main dashboard displays welcome screen without data
- [x] Navigation between dashboard views works (Dashboard, Performance, Analytical, Financial)
- [x] Region filtering implemented (All, Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao)
- [x] Upload modal opens and file selection works
- [x] Excel processing logic handles data correctly
- [x] Status cards display parcel counts by status
- [x] Charts and tables render properly in reports
- [x] Filtering by province, month, year implemented
- [x] Financial calculations accurate (gross sales, profits, RTS impact)

## Key Findings
- Code is well-structured with proper TypeScript usage
- Components are modular and reusable
- Data processing handles Excel files correctly
- UI uses consistent design system (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- All dashboard views have proper error handling for no data state
- Filtering and region selection work across all reports

## Recommendations
- Consider adding unit tests for data processing functions
- Add loading states for data processing
- Implement data persistence (localStorage or database)
- Add export functionality for reports

## Status
✅ All code reviewed and accurate
✅ All dashboards properly implemented and functional
✅ Application running successfully
